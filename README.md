# 2-Day Workshop in WASHINGTON, DC

## PK-Sim® &amp; MoBi® workshop on PBPK and PBPK-based QSP 

esqLABS is running a two-day hands-on **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** workshop on **PBPK and PBPK-based QSP** on **Saturday and Sunday 16th and 17th of March 2019** (post ASCPT) at the University of Maryland in **Washington, DC**. The workshop covers the **basics of PBPK** and concepts and application of **combining PK-Sim, MoBi and R** to build your very own digital platforms for the prediction of clinical trial outcomes by leveraging physiological and mechanistic knowledge to translate early in-vitro and preclinical outcomes to the clinic. During hands-on exercises you will learn how to:
- [x] Build a PBPK model in PK-Sim and compare to observed data
- [x] Learn how to consider age-dependency in drug PK in PK-Sim (Pediatrics and Geriatrics)
- [x] Conduct population simulations in PK-Sim and MoBi
- [x] Learn how to model drug-drug interactions in PK-Sim (DDI)
- [x] Integrate mechanism-based pharmacodynamics in MoBi
- [x] Conduct parameter identifications in PK-Sim and MoBi
- [x] Simulate and analyze your PBPK-QSP model in R

This workshop will be held by the consultants and scientists from esqlabs GmbH with extensive experience in the use of **PK-Sim® & MoBi®** in all application areas. 

While the workshop does not require any prior experience with PK-Sim® & MoBi®, many topics will be of interest even for advanced users.

## AGENDA

As use-cases for above learnings, we will develop PBPK models for small molecules and biologics and a PB-QSP model for naked antibody pre-treatment (nAb) for antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) treatment of tumor growth, in detail (preliminary agenda):
